## Challenges that I have encountered while working on the tasks:

In order to complete this project Ihad to learn a lot by myself:
1. Python packages such as psutil, os, sys, pytest etc.
2. what is docker file and how to build and use it.
3. how to write requirements automatically
4. how to monitor bash commands
5. how to write a singletone class in python
6. how to handle signals in python
